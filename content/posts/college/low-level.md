## Storage Types
* **auto**: Default storage class. Stored on stack.
* **extern**: Global variable. Used for declarations only.
* **static**: Stored in data segment. Sort of like global
* **register**: Can be stored in register, but more of a suggestion to compiler.

## Base Conversions

### Decimal to Base B
* Use Euclid's algorithm to convert from decimal to base b.

### Base B to Decimal
* Use the following to convert from base b to decimal
$$ n = a_k b^{k-1} + a_{k-2} b^{k-1} ... + a_{2} b^1 + a_1 b^0$$

#### Example
$$ 987_{10} = 9 \cdot 10^2 + 8 \cdot 10^1 + 7 \cdot 10^0$$

### Binary to Hexadecimal
Each nibble (4 bits) is one hexadecimal digit

#### Example
0100 1110 1100 0011 to hexadecimal  
4    E    C    B

### Hexadecimal to Binary
Opposite of above

### Binary to Octal
Every 3 bits is one octal digit

#### Example
110 111 011 001 011 to octal  
4   7   3   1   3

### Binary Addition
**And** determines whether a carry results  
**Xor** is like an addition

### Negative Number Representation

#### Signed Magnitude Representation
* Just use the first bit as a flag to indicate whether the number is positive or negative
* E.g. 
  * -1 is just 1001 for a 4 bit integer
  * -4 is just 1100 for a 4 bit integer

* Cons
  * Wasted space by duplicate +0 and -0
  * Addition of a positive number and the corresponding negative don't yield an expected result

#### One's Complement
* Take the bitwise inverse of the positive representation
* E.g.
  * 1 is 0001, so -1 is 1110
  * 4 is 0100, so -4 is 1011

### Two's Complement
* Bitwise inverse of positive representation + 1
* E.g. 
  * 1 is 0001, so -1 is 1111
  * 4 is 0100, so -4 is 1100

* Pros
  * No duplicate 0 representation
  * Addition of negative and positive numbers works
