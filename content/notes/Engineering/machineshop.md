## Shop Safety
* No long hair, jewelry, etc.
* Closed Toed-Shoes
* Long Sleeves (Even in summer)
* You and at least 2 people in the shop
* Emergency phone automatically dials police and emergency
* Safety Glasses

## General Advice
* Paint denotes material type on a piece of stock 
* When cutting stock material, cut the end without paint, so we know what material it is

## Horizontal Band Saw
* Used to cut longer pieces
  * Can only cut straight down
* Make sure the blade is NOT touching the material when you start the saw, or else the blade teeth in contact with the material will chip or break

## Vertical Band Saw
* You can do some more complicated patterns than the horizontal band saw
* Use block of wood to push the piece you're cutting towards the blade
* Shouldn't be too hard to push material towards blade when cutting
  * If it is, blade might be dull, inform shop people

## Belt Sander
* Used to sand and remove burs from materials
* Move the piece around horizontally, so you don't wear out just one spot on the belt
* Make sure the piece is pointed downwards since the belt spins down
  * If it was pointed upwards, the belt would push the part down while you're holding it and might pinch your fingers or something bad

## Disk Sander
* The disc spins *counterclockwise*, so put the piece you're sanding to the left, so the chips go DOWN
  * Putting the piece to the right will cause the metal chips to go tangential (UP) which is bad

## Mill
* When drilling, don't hit the vice (expensive vice)
* Don't use drill chuck to hold end mill bits

### Parts
* Vice
* Brake
  * Used to prevent the spindle from rotating
* Lock
  * Prevents quill from moving up and down
* Stop
  * Stops quill from going down to a certain height
* Out/In Pneumatic
  * Used to take the drill chuck/end mill holder assembly out or put it back in
  * Put Stop all the way to the top and set lock when using
* Autofeed
  * Automatically set the X and Y to go a certain speed

### Drilling
<!-- * Use a bit to find location -->
<!-- * Use first bit to make small indentation -->


## Lathe

### SAFETY
1. **NEVER leave chuck Key in** or it might spin and go flying and hurt someone
2. **Keep a hand on the lever that turns on spinning** so you can shut it off if something is loose or something goes wrong
3. **Use a brush to clean up the chips**

### Parts
* Lever for spinning lathe spindle
  * Forward - To the right and up
  * Neutral
  * Reverse
* Pedal Brake: Stops the lathe from spinning
* Chuck
  * Holds the part you want to do stuff with
* Tailstock
  * Used if you want to drill or tap
* Lubricant
  * Should use when cutting
  * Must use when drilling
  * Use as little as possible

## Tapping
* Use tap magic
  * Apply a bunch, don't be stingy
* Do like a turn or two and then break the chips by doing a quick small turn in the opposite direction
