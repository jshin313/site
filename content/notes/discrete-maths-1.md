This class is called **Mathematical Concepts in Computing I** at my college and covers propositions/predicates, sequences, number theory, set theory, functions, matrices, basic proof techniques, combinatorics, counting, relations, and trees/graphs.

Book Used: **Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen**  
The book had some nice examples and problems, but sometimes explanations were bad.

These are my notes, so there's probably stuff that I got wrong. Comment if you find mistakes.

Helpful websites and resources I used for the class:
* [Kimberly Brehm's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz). Pretty good explanations.
* https://math.berkeley.edu/~arash/55/: Condensed version of book chapters. A bit hard to read sometimes.
* https://www.slader.com/: For solutions to book problems

## Counting and Combinatorics (Chapter 6):


## Miscallaneous:
### Fast Multiplication: Karatsuba's Algorithm 
Notes based on https://youtu.be/-dfsxsiGoC8 since the video goes more in-depth.
