These are the notes I took via $\LaTeX$ throughout my university studies.

For an overview of all my notes in chronological order click [here](/tags/notes/). I actually started out as a computer science major, but you can see from the notes that I switch to physics.

Courses denoted with an asterisk, *, are courses that I didn't take through my university and instead self-learned through books or online lectures.
